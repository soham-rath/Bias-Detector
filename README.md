# Bias-Detector â€“ Smashing Hidden Bias in Text

## Overview

Political content can be persuasive without being outright false. Words shape perception subtly, and I wanted to build a tool that lets **people see through propaganda** and make informed judgments.
**BiasBreaker** is a browser extension that helps users uncover subtle bias, loaded language, and propaganda in political speeches, articles, and social media posts. It highlights emotionally charged words, scores text for neutrality, and empowers users to critically analyze content in real time.

## Features

- Highlights **loaded or emotionally charged words**
- Detects **bias and propaganda**
- Provides a **neutrality score** for text
- Works seamlessly on **Chrome and Brave**

---

## How It Works

1. The extension extracts the page text and sends it to the backend AI server.
2. The AI analyzes the text for loaded words, emotional language, and context-based bias.
3. The extension highlights key words and displays a **summary neutrality score** in real time.
